# AOC-2024

This repo is available for anyone at Expedient to fork and then use to submit their solutions for [advent of code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) challenges in 2024.   
Please make sure to name any input files you create ending in `.input.txt` to avoid checking in problem inputs (which is against the AOC TOS).

I you haven't already, please make sure to reach out to @mgaruccio to get yourself added to the Teams channel to discuss the contest as we go through the challenges.

Also please feel free to ask for help getting started if you're a beginner, the group will be happy to provide hints and other assistance for any of the challenges after the first day they are up.

Good luck to everyone!
